Rest-Emulator

Usage: add new rest service in conf/routes

Then add the controller under controllers , and add the xml you want to be returned under datasets/{set}/{service}/xml
If you want to return error codes , like if you want to emulate same error that can occured like when a user exist.
You can then add reponse codes to the response as in the example in Account. This make it a very powerful way to test
your code during development or integration-tests.
