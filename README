Rest-Emulator
is a simple project written in the PlayFramework to emulate a Rest-based backend

Its makes it possible to emulate and control the backend during development and integration-testing.
By having control over the test-data in the backend you can develop faster since u dont have to worry about test-data changing.
You can stretch it even further and have the emulator returning error codes for specific scenarios. This make it very powerful.

The application is started by typing play run

You add new services by adding a urlpattering in conf/routes, then add a controller under controllers , and then add the xml you want to be returned under datasets/{set}/{service}/xml

then youre ready to go..

Since Play compiles to code no restart is necessary
